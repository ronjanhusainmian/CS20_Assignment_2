                Founded in 2018 in the heart of Boston, MA, Cupcake Carousel began with a 
                simple dream: to bring people together over beautifully crafted cupcakes 
                that taste as delightful as they look. What started as a small neighborhood 
                kitchen project quickly grew into a beloved bakery, known for its whimsical 
                flavors, pastel-colored frostings, and playful presentation. Inspired by 
                the joy of carousels spinning with color and music, we wanted our bakery 
                to capture that same sense of wonder and celebration. From our earliest days, 
                every cupcake has been baked with care, using quality ingredients and a dash 
                of creativity, to make each visit feel special. Today, Cupcake Carousel 
                continues to be a place where locals and visitors alike can enjoy a sweet 
                moment of happiness.
